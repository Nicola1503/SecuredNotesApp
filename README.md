SecureNotesApp Project Overview 

The SecureNotesApp is a Java-based desktop application designed to securely create, manage, and access personal notes.
Built with a focus on data privacy and usability,this application uses modern development practices,
 including JDBC for database connectivity, MySQL for data storage, and Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
 The project aims to provide a functional, user-friendly, and secure platform for users to manage sensitive information such as 
 passwords, ideas, or personal notes.
